# Advent of Code 2021
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles. This year, I have attempted to solve the exercises in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), a functional programming language that I need to learn for the ["Programming Paradigms"](https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/lehre/WS202122/paradigmen/index.php?lang=de) course at my university.

## Running the solution code
The solution algorithms are implemented in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) and have been tested with GHC 9.0.1 on Windows.

If you are using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can run each day's solution by running the respective [task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks). Otherwise, just run `runghc dayXX.hs` inside the day's folder.

To run the solution algorithm with your own puzzle input, just replace the `input.txt` file in the day's folder with your own puzzle input and run the solution algorithm again.

## File structure
* [`.vscode/tasks.json`](./.vscode/tasks.json): configuration file that allows running my code through VS Code
* `./dayXX/`: Puzzle input, description and solution code for the XX-th day of the advent calendar
    * [`./day01/`](./day01): Sonar Sweep
    * [`./day02/`](./day02): Dive!
* [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore): configuration file that keeps generated files out of the git repo
* [`README.md`](./README.md): description of and instructions for this repository
